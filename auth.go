// in scope B if B is a prefix to A. For example, you can check if a user is
// allowed to read or write from the "Example" API by checking the
// "api.example.read" or "api.example.write" scope. When you grant the scope to
// a user you can now either decide only to grant the very specific
// "api.example.read" scope which means the user will not have write permissions
// or you can allow people write-only access via "api.example.write".
// Alternatively you can also grant any access to the Example API via "api.example"
// which includes both the read and write scope beneath it. If you choose to you
// could also allow even more general access to everything in the api via the
// "api" scope. The empty scope "" cannot be granted and will thus always return
// an error in the permission check.
