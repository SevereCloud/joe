# Joe Examples

This directory contains the example code that you can find on the main
[README.md](../README.md) of this repository. The purpose is to be able to
be able to actually compile the provided examples to make sure they do net get
outdated as joes API develops. The neccessary automation to keep the examples
and the README.md in sync is done via [embedmd](https://github.com/campoy/embedmd).
